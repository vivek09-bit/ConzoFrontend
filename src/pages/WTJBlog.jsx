                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Why do I need to convert a .WEBP to JPG format?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Think of JPG as the universal language of images. While WEBP is a more modern, efficient format that's great for web performance, many older software programs, desktop applications, and some social media platforms still don't fully support it. When you perform a <strong>WEBP to JPG</strong> conversion, you are translating your image into a format that is guaranteed to work everywhere, ensuring maximum compatibility for editing, sharing, and printing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="py-6 border-b border-gray-200">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Will I lose any quality when converting?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">This is a common concern, and a valid one. Both WEBP and JPG are "lossy" formats, meaning they use compression to reduce file size. However, our tool is engineered to minimize this loss. We prioritize creating a <strong>high-quality</strong> JPEG file that retains as much detail as possible. For the vast majority of use cases, any difference in quality will be imperceptible to the human eye.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">What is the difference between JPG and JPEG?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">There is no difference in the format itself! JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the official name of the compression standard. JPG is simply the three-letter file extension that became standard in older Windows systems. So, when you use a <strong>WEBP to JPEG</strong> converter, you are creating a .jpg file. They are functionally identical.</p>
